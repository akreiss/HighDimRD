Description: This package povides functions for the inclusion of high-dimensio-
    nal covariates in regression discontinuity problems. The main function for
    this purpose is HighDim_rd. Details of its functionality are contained in
    the paper Kreiss and Rothe (2021). The basic functionality is that in a
    first step the algorithm selects relevant covariates by means of a Lasso
    procedure. In a second step the treatment effect is estimated by using these
    selected covariates. In addition, there are some functions which create in-
    teractions, cross-interactions and Fourier expansions in order to generate
    high-dimensional covariates.
